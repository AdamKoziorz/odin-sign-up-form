# odin-sign-up-form

I am completing various small projects as part of the Odin Project. "Sign-Up Form" is the first project in the Full-stack Javascript course and the first project in the intermediate HTML/CSS course. This project tests form creation and form validation as well as intermediate CSS concepts such as positioning, units, functions, and advanced selectors.

This site is responsive for desktop but not for mobile as this has not been covered yet in the curriculum.
